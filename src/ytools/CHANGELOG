2005-10-21: Added calls to 'force-output' to make queries work
            properly under SBCL.  Changed parameter
            ytools-bin-dir-pathname* in ytools.lsy to allow
            non-relative bin directory for YTools.
            
2005-10-19: Fixed bug in 'declare-pathname-associate'

2005-10-11: Replaced calls to 'file-write-date' with calls to
            'pathname-write-time' in cases where file is not known to
            exist.  (Version 2.0.13.)

2005-10-10: Workarounds for bugs in Open MCL.

2005-10-09: Creating Ever-loaded chunks; not integrated yet (or
            working correctly, for that matter).  Corrected various
            technicalities to get Open MCL to compile YTools.  Created
            simple repl (repl.lisp) for use in slime debugger.

2005-10-07: Allowed names of config files to be something other than
            "ytconfig.lisp".  Broadened declarations of allowed values
            of fields in chunks to make openmcl compiler happy.

2005-09-13: Moved facilities of multvalhacks.lisp into multilet.lisp.
            Changed 'loadeds-check-bases' so it postpones rescans if
            chunk update is already in progress. (Version 2.0.12)

2005-09-03: Inserted :before method for (setf Chunk-date) on
            Code-file-chunk to try to catch the mysterious culprit
            that occasionally tries to set a Code-file-chunk's date to
            something before its file's write date.  No hit so far.

2005-07-29: Added 'on-list-if-new', *current-case-mode*

2005-07-28: Allowed derivers and date-derivers to terminate management
            of their chunks if found to be defective in some way;
            chunks-update will then skip any further handling of them.
	    This is used in the case of code-file chunks for
            nonexistent files.
	    'fload' and 'fcompl' now remind user if there are
            postponed file ops. (Version 2.0.11)

2005-07-24: Added 'with-open-files' to multvalhacks.lisp.
	    Revamped the way file-header slurping is related to chunk
            for file being slurped.  (Version 2.0.10)

2005-07-21: Replaced <- and *undef with :<- and :*undef in filedeps.lisp.

2005-06-30: Changed naming convention for form chunks derived from
            modules, so that redefining module erases the old form
            chunk rather than just adding a new one.

2005-06-24: Moved keyword-args-extract to misc.lisp.  Add 'in-header'
            (file depend.lisp). Fixed bug in fload (so -x flag
            works). (Version 2.0.09.)

2005-06-17: Added file multvalhacks.lisp .  (Version 2.0.08)

2005-05-30: Added 'find-chunk'.  Fixed bug in 'chunk-destroy'.  Fixed
            bugs in request-mgt logic.  Added some debugging
            statements.  Changed chunk printer.

2005-05-28: Made flags in 'fload' and 'fcompl' characters, not symbols
            interned in the yt package.  Added -n flag (force
            "normality"). 

2005-05-27: Made scan for "Readtable: " in mode line case-insensitive.

2005-05-04: Gave user options in case fload reports that previous
            attempt to compile a file failed.  (Version 2.0.06)

2005-05-03: Introduced chunk for pathname associates.
            Dir-associate-chunk (pathname.lisp) keeps track of the
            association of a property with a pathname.
            Compiled-file-chunks depend on association of 'bin'
            properties with directories. (Version 2.0.05)

2005-04-20: Ensured that if bin directory of a source directory
            changes, fload will notice that the next time it compiles
            a file in the source directory.  (Version 2.0.04)            

2005-04-17: Eliminated double-compilation bug in (fload -c ...).
            Suppressed annoying message about chunk times differing by
            1 second.  Fixed bug preventing proper reset of basis by
            'loaded-chunk-set-basis'.  Made sure scan-depends-on is
            preceded by reset of bases of all relevant
            chunks. (Version 2.0.03)

2005-04-16: Eliminated bug in logic in 'loaded-chunk-set-basis'.
            (Version 2.0.02)

2005-04-06: Added slurp handlers for various forms. (Version 2.0.01)

2005-03-27: Rethink of alt-version hack for Code-file-chunks.
            Reintroduced idea from old YTools of having lightweight
            version control apply purely at the file-list-parsing
            level (e.g., in parsing the arguments to 'fload').

            Got slurp dependencies right (or more nearly right) in
            file chunks.

2005-03-16: Rethink of what it means to slurp a module definition.            
	    Corrected bug in implementation of -x flag to 'fload'.

2005-03-13: Debugged interaction between 'depends-on' and
            'self-compile-dep'. More tuning of ynisp to new chunk
            system.  

2005-03-12: Better cycle detection in chunk network.  Implemented
            'at-slurp-time' dependencies.

2005-03-06: Further debugging of flags to fload and fcompl.  (Version 1.5.1)

2005-03-05: One more retune of derive-date/derive ritual.  
	    Made interrogation about what version of files to load
            more intelligible.  Began work on getting force flags to
            work correctly.  (Version 1.5)

2005-03-02: Split derivers into two generic functions, derive-date and
            derive.  Leaf chunks can be out of date.  'derive' is
            called the same way for leaves and non-leaves. (Version
            1.4.11) 

2005-02-27: Yet another scheme for controlling chunk updates triggered
            by chunk derivers: The interrupt is detected by the outer
            update, which is then restarted.  The inner update does
            not happen again because derivers are called only once at
            a particular level.

	    Added ability to postpone updates of derivees, to avoid
            repeated updates of the same irrelevant downstream derivee
            during debugging of upstream chunk. (Version 1.4.10)

2004-11-07: Resurrected 'intercept' and 'pass' with improved type
            checking. (Version 1.4.8.7)

2004-10-30: Changed output for warning message in 'decipher-readtable'
            (slurp.lisp). (Version 1.4.8.6)

2004-10-29: Wrapped #+openmcl around code referring to ccl
            package. (Version 1.4.8.5.)

2004-10-26: Fixed bug in outin whereby nonstreams were making it into
            the variable 'out-streams*' (probably because Allegro does
            something odd to streams when it closes them).  (Version
            1.4.8.4)

2004-10-05: One more tweak to logic of 'compilable' in
            lprec-check-compile. (Version 1.4.8.3)

2004-10-04: Fixed bugs introduced by fixes of 10-02. 
	    Added second value returned by
            'ytools-logical-pathname-def' (the bin directory)
	    (Version 1.4.8.2)

2004-10-02: Replaced 'lisp:' with 'cl:' in a couple of files.
            Stopped 'fload' from trying to compile files with types
            other than Lisp source. (Version 1.4.8)

2004-10-01: Define 'ytools-logical-pathname-def' to make it easy to
            find the definition of a YTools logical pathname. (Version 1.4.7)

2004-09-29: Added convenience function (in-ytools), which sets
            *package* and *readtable* to their proper YTools
            values. (Version 1.4.6)

2004-09-26: Patch 'subr-synonym' to cope with bug in OpenMCL.
            (Version 1.4.5)

2004-09-19: Define 'is-list' in base.lisp as synonym for 'listp'.
            Minor change to 'datafun-table' in datafun.lisp.

2004-09-16: Added field :initbind e to (x :in l) clause of
            'repeat'. The expression e is evaluated and bound to x
            initially.  This is purely to satisfy some compilers that
            complain if x is declared to be of some type incompatible
            with an initial value of nil.  (Version 1.4.4)

2004-09-11: Change 'ytools-module-load' in module.lisp so that
            expansion of module is evalualated when module is loaded.

2004-09-02: Replace 'assoc' with 'assq' in expansion of 'alist-entry'
            (to avoid confusing Nisp). (Version 1.4.3)

2004-08-22: Interaction between 'outin' and pretty-printer streamlined.
	
2004-08-11: Stuff after :proceed and :prompt-for is now a list of args
            suitable for 'out'.  In the case of :prompt-for, the last
	    element is the default, and the out-args don't include that
	    last element.
	
2004-08-09: Change in bq.lisp to allow other files to use its facilities.
	    Invisible to users.  Changed logic in 'fload' so after asking
	    whether to compile a previously uncompiled file it doesn't
	    consider loading old (nonexistent) object code.  (Version 1.4.2)
	
2004-08-06: Introduced :|| as prettier synonym for :\|
	
2004-08-03: Altered implementation of '!' dispatch macro; change
            invisible to users.  Another invisible change to
            subr-synonym (allows specification of numargs).
	
2004-07-30: Made ytdoc.pdf part of the CVS system, so it will be part of
            the "nightly snapshot."  (Version 1.4.1)
	
2004-07-25: Adding 'nthrest'
	
2004-07-10: Simplified Qvar as type	
	
2004-07-09: Added gen-var
	
2004-07-06: Tiny bug fix in setter
	
2004-06-25: Further enhancements to alref. .  Made packages work in
	    names of YTools logical pathnames.  Fixed bug in 'repeat'
	    for var notation (v e0 :then e1) so it's the same as (v =
	    e0 :then e1).  Got 'fload-recheck' working correctly.
	    Version 1.4
	
2004-06-24: Improved definition of 'alref.' so it allows specification
            of equality test, access method, and new-entry builder.
	    Allow package names to occur inside YTools logical pathnames.
	
2004-04-20: Added 'val-or-initialize' and its notational variant,
            'memoize-val', to misc.  Tightened definitions of 'alref' and
	    'alref.' .
	
2004-03-14: Added debug.lisp
	
2004-03-09: Changes for portability.
	
2003-12-17: (branch ytools-1-2-dev) Rejiggered logic to checking
	    whether to recompile in files.lisp.  Eventually this will be
	    right, by the monkeys-and-typewriters theorem.
	
2003-12-11: (branch ytools-1-2-dev) Rewrote file-update checker to get
            right the logic of when to recompile or reload a file.
	
2003-11-08: Slight change to an error message in pathname.lisp.
	
2003-10-28: Changed ytload.lisp to allow .lmd files to be in arbitrary places
	
2003-10-27: Eliminated Allegro check in depend.lisp"
	
2003-10-26: Added 'ytcopy.lisp' utility
	
2003-08-24: Declared var fload-compile* properly.
	    Better y-n query handling in one place
	    Still struggling with precise definition of 'depends-on'
	
2003-08-15: Slight reorganization of 'repeat.lisp' to split some local
	    functions off so they can be used elsewhere.
	
2003-08-14: Changed handling of datafuns on property lists, adding
            'datafun-on-plist'.
	    In mapper.lisp, had to explicitly declare that 'mapmac'
	    property is stored on symbol plists.  Ditto for 'match-code'
	    property in setter.lisp.
	    Slight bug fix in setter.lisp
	
2003-08-06: Fixed bug in pathname.lisp	    
	
2003-08-03: Added '--' to base.lisp
	
2003-07-13: Replaced :continue with :proceed in 'signal-problem'.  Made
            the string after :proceed evaluable.
